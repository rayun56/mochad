# Why another fork???
rayun56 here. This is a very simple fork of sigmdel's mochad fork, which simply reverts the line endings returned to
netcat clients from `\n\r` to `\n`. Why is this needed? In a nutshell, home assistant. HA uses the
[pymochad library](https://github.com/mtreinish/pymochad) for interfacing with a mochad server, and that library was
never properly updated to support the other line endings. This causes HA to not properly parse any messages from mochad, 
and thus makes it unusable.

This fork allows for mochad to be used with home assistant without needing to modify the pymochad library.
The original readme is below, all the instructions are exactly the same.

# MOCHAD

`mochad` is a Linux TCP gateway daemon for the X10 CM15A RF (radio frequency) and
PL (power line) and the CM19A RF controllers.

## 1. Why this Fork ?

Changes were needed to the [Neil Cherry (linuxha) fork](https://github.com/linuxha/mochad) to compile and install `mochad` on recent versions of Linux with the `systemd` init system. Specifically this fork has been tested on the following 64-bit systems. 

- x86_64 GNU/Linux : Mint 20.1, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal), Linux 5.4.0-124

- aarch64 GNU/Linux : Armbian 22.05.3, Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (jammy), Linux 5.10.123-meson64 

- aarch64 GNU/Linux : Raspberry Pi OS 2022-04-04, Debian 11.4 (bullseye), Linux 5.15.32-v8+

Installation was also tested on the latest 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS for Arm V6 (for Raspberry Pi B and Raspberry Pi Zero)

- armv6l GNU/Linux : Raspberry Pi OS 2024-01-25, Debian 12.1 (bookworm), Linux 6.1.0

## 2. Need for Changes

### 2.1. Source

`mochad` could not be built because of the following linking errors

    /usr/bin/ld: decode.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:31: multiple definition of `RfToRf16'; mochad.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:31: first defined here
    /usr/bin/ld: decode.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:29: multiple definition of `RfToPl16'; mochad.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:29: first defined here
    /usr/bin/ld: decode.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:26: multiple definition of `PollTimeOut'; mochad.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:26: first defined here
    /usr/bin/ld: decode.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:25: multiple definition of `Cm19a'; mochad.o:/home/hestia/mochad-master/global.h:25: first defined here

The problem was solved by declaring those variables as `extern` in `global.h` and defining `PollTimeOut` in `global.c`.

### 2.2. Configuration

The `mochad` service was not installed properly in `systemd` and it would stop functioning with a 

    usb_claim_interface failed -6

error. 

The solution was to restore the `systemd` and `udev` directories found in the original [mochad-0.1.17](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mochad/files/) repository by mmauka. Modification of the `Makefile.am` was also necessary.

## 3. Patching Version 0.1.17 by mmauka

Instead of installing this fork, one could apply a couple of small patches to version 0.1.17 of `mochad` from the original author mmauka. The patches and details are in the [res directory](res/README.md).  

If IPV6 support is needed then this fork will have to be installed as explained later.

## 4. Installation of `mochad`

**FR:** Il y a une [traduction en français de ces instructions](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/domoticz/mochad_on_recent_linux_distro_fr.html#installation). 


### 4.1. Install prerequisite

The userspace USB programming library development files are needed to use the `libusb-1` library.

    $ sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev

On the Raspberry Pi, it was also necessary to install `autoconf`.

    $ sudo apt install autoconf

While not strictly necessary, `netcat` is useful when testing the `mochad` deaemon. It was present on some test platforms but not all.    

    $ sudo apt install netcat-openbsd

### 4.2. Get the source

The source code on GitHub can be obtained with any one of the usual methods. Notably

#### 4.2.1. by cloning the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/sigmdel/mochad.git
    $ cd mochad


#### 4.2.2. by downloading the archive

    $ wget https://github.com/sigmdel/mochad/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip
    $ cd mochad-master
   
The current work directory should contain the source including `mochad.c`  and `autogen.sh`.

### 4.3. Enable IPV6 support (optional)

By default, IPV6 is not enabled until the value of the IPV6 macro at the very start of `mochad.c` is changed from 0 to 1.

```c
  #define IPV6    1
```
I do not use IPV6 and have not tested that code at all. Any questions about that feature would have to be addressed to its author, [Neil Cherry](https://github.com/linuxha/mochad).

### 4.4. Compile the source

While it should be, make sure that `autogen.sh` is an executable.

    $ chmod +x autogen.sh 

Run the script.

    $ ./autogen.sh


This will create the `Makefile`, so now run `make`.

    $ make

### 4.5. Install the package

    $ sudo make install

Again within the directory containing the source.

### 4.6. Confirm the presence of installed files 

     /usr/local/bin/mochad
     /etc/udev/rules/91-usb-x10-controllers.rules

In `systemd` a service file is also installed.

     /etc/systemd/system/mochad.service 

Note that the service will remain inactive until a CM1xA is connected to the system. That's the reason for the `udev` rules.

## 5. Test

First connect a CM15A or CM19A to a USB port. Test the service by connecting to `mochad` using `netcat` and pressing buttons of an X10 RF remote. Hopefully, something similar to this will occur.

    $  nc localhost 1099
    02/03 19:27:40 Rx RF HouseUnit: K4 Func: On
    02/03 19:27:44 Rx RF HouseUnit: K6 Func: Off
    02/03 19:27:46 Rx RF House: K Func: Dim

Use the `Ctrl+C` keyboard combination to close `netcat`. 

## 6. USB Interface Error

If nothing happened when pressing a button on the remote, look at the status of `mochad`.

    $ systemctl status mochad.service
    ● mochad.service - Mochad a TCP gateway service for X10-RF (CM15A/CM15Pro/CM19A)
        Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mochad.service; disabled; preset: enabled)
      ... 
      ...  mochad[739]: usb_claim_interface failed -6
      ... 

Should a **`usb_claim_interface failed -6`**  error be present as shown above, check if the `ati_remote` driver is running.

    $ lsmod | grep ati_remote
    ati_remote              9260  0   

The Lola remote for ATI All-In-Wonder video card has the same `0x0bc7:0x002` id as the CM19A. Because of that, the [ati_remote](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/media/rc/ati_remote.c) driver will be loaded. Blacklist the module and the problem should be solved. 

     $ echo "blacklist ati_remote" | sudo tee /usr/lib/modprobe.d/ati-remote-blacklist.conf

Simply trying to unload the module with a `sudo modprobe -r ati_remote` will probably not work; blacklisting and rebooting will be necessary.

## 7. Cleanup

Once the installation is completed, the `mochad` source directory can be deleted if desired. The archive `master.zip` can also be erased if it was downloaded to obtain the source code.

## 8. More Information

The [original README](README) text file contains much more information.

The version of `mochad.service` found in this fork comes from Andreas's [2021-09-07 post](https://sourceforge.net/p/mochad/discussion/1320002/thread/764dd1ce44/#76e9) on the flimsy grounds that the unit file looks more sophisticated. Compare it with [another version](https://github.com/ermshiperete/mochad/blob/master/systemd/mochad.service) by Eberhard Beilharz (ermshiperete).

Steve Porter provides a fork of the mmauka 0.0.17 version which he presents as [mochad-0.1.21](https://sourceforge.net/p/mochad/discussion/1320002/thread/9e758b6afc/7c52/attachment/mochad-0.1.21.tgz). It is a different solution to the compilation problem. See details [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/mochad/discussion/1320002/thread/9e758b6afc/). Casey Langen (clangen) has incorporated the changes by Steve Porter into another [mochad](https://github.com/clangen/mochad) GitHub repository.

**FR:** Il a plus de détails au sujet de cette fourche dans un billet intitulé [Mochad sur les distributions Linux récentes](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/domoticz/mochad_on_recent_linux_distro_fr.html). 

## 9. Shameless Self Promotion

The [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) *Mochad CM15Pro/CM19A bridge with LAN interface* decodes only the On and Off packets received from `mochad`. When the Mochad bridge receives Dim or Bright packets from `mochad`, it reports a decode error. The [mochas](https://github.com/sigmdel/mochas) repository contains a Python script that can be run as a service connected to `mochad` to handle these packets.
